# Hide Reddit Bots and Users

Browser extension (Chrome initially) to hide specific Reddit users and/or bots

I developed this extension to hide comments from certain rather
verbose bots whose long posts I didn't want to have to slog through
while scrolling down through comments.

You can use this to hide comments from certain users as well.  This
extension does not differentiate between bots and human users.

It only hides the text of the comments.  It doesn't collapse threads,
so you will still see replies to the bots or users you are ignoring.

The list of users is synced with your Google account.
