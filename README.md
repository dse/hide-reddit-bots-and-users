# Hide Reddit Bots and Users

Browser extension (Chrome initially) to hide specific Reddit bots and/or users

I developed this extension to hide comments from certain rather
verbose bots whose long posts I didn't want to have to slog through
while scrolling down through comments.

You can use this to hide comments from certain non-bot users as well.
This extension does not differentiate between bots and human users.

It only hides the text of their comments, as well as "reply" and other
buttons other than "show author".  It doesn't collapse threads, so you
will still see replies to the bots or users you are ignoring.

The list of users whose comments are hidden is synced with your Google
account.
